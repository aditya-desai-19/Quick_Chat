## Motivation

To enhance my frontend skills, I embarked on developing a chat application using React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. Throughout this project, I've incorporated various fundamental concepts of React, including but not limited to the useState, useEffect, useRef, and useContext hooks. Additionally, I've delved into a plethora of other React concepts to ensure a robust and efficient frontend implementation.
